## Rick and Morty Compendium

This project is bootstrapped with Next.js, mostly to access Vercels deploy platform. 

The current deployment can be accessed here: [https://rick-and-morty-compendium.vercel.app/]

The project used Chakra-UI as component library, since that's what I'm familiar with, but Radix could be a good alternative for unstyled components. React-data-table is used for table setup, since this is a clean-looking, intuitive library with a easy-to-use expanding table option.

The Rick and Morty api has it's own package with methods and types for easier development when using REST.

If you wan't to run the project locally then here's some instructions below:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
